Logos are one of the hardest things to design. A logo which can say something about a product while staying clean and simple is not easy to create. The top logo was done for Hug Fest International. I feel this is a good example of a sucessful logo. It is simple, it is memorable, and it tells the viewer something about the product, event, or company behind the logo.

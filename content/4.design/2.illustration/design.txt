These illustrations are done by taking photos and then hand-tracing them in Adobe Illustrator. Most of them are self-portraits or portraits of friends. I enjoy doing these works because of the freedom of expression one can have while creating something like this. None of these were done for a client, but this is a good example of where my skills at the finer arts lie. If you want one of yourself, send me a picture and I'll see what I can do.
